### Firth - a command line wrapper for ffmpeg

Tested with Ruby v2.5.3

Run `bundle install` to install the dependencies

Ensure `ffmpeg` is installed and available in $PATH - see https://ffmpeg.org/download.html for more details

From the project root run `./bin/firth URL` where a GET request to the URL returns appropriate JSON data
